I'm on the path to becoming a JavaScript enthusiast.

### What I'm currently working on
Right now I'm working on building a general purpose platform app with all sorts of random features as I learn more about JavaScript and Web Development. This is essentially going to be a base for learning purposes

I'm hoping to have a functional version of this app by the end of this year and hopefully learn Angular along the way.

### What I'm currently learning
I'm participating in the Google Africa Developer Scholarship program under the Mobile Web Specialist track

### Fun fact:
This name was originally just a typo
