# About

This git-book was inspired by Max Antonucci whose notes on life and coding has helped me and heavily influenced how I see and approach code today. So following in his 'Exocortex' git book example, I will be using this git-book in a similar manner and I hope that it helps whoever stumbles upon this someday in the same way his notes helped me.
