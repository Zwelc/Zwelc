### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm on the path to becoming a JavaScript enthusiast.

### Current Situation:
Right now I'm working on building a general purpose platform app with all sorts of random features as I learn more about JavaScript and Web Development. This is essentially going to be a base for learning purposes

I'm hoping to have a functional version of this app by the end of this year and hopefully learn Angular along the way.

I'm also participating in the Google Africa Developer Scholarship program under the Mobile Web Specialist track
